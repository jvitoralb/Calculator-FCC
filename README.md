## This is a Calculator

This project fulfills the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects.

This project is a basic one, I didn't work too hard on this one because I recently did another [JS Calculator](https://github.com/jvitoralb/Calculator-JS) which is more complex, so this one I just did for the curriculum.  
Here I just worked through the tests and used Bootstrap and JavaScript only.
