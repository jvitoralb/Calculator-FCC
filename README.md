## This is a Calculator

This project fulfills the freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries Projects.

NOTE: I Had some problems with the test `13` because it doesn't recognize the way I did it, which was for all the signs (+, -, /, *) to be overruled by the last one, so if you want to use negative numbers have to click the "+/-" button, but the test wants me to use the `-` operation sign to turn a number negative.

`13. If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign). For example, if 5 + * 7 = is entered, the result should be 35 (i.e. 5 * 7); if 5 * - 5 = is entered, the result should be -25 (i.e. 5 * (-5)).`

This project is a basic one, I didn't work too hard on this one because I recently did another [JS Calculator](https://github.com/jvitoralb/Calculator-JS) which is more complex, so this one I just did for the curriculum.  
Here I just worked through the tests and used Bootstrap and JavaScript only.
